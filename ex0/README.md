## Description

Accelerate development by using SAP Build Code to consume a SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) Model service for mobile development. Build a native, cross-platform mobile application using mobile development kit and bring all of your work together on the SAP Mobile Start app - the launchpad for mobile apps from SAP.

## Requirements

In order to complete the session exercises below, first complete the [pre-requisites](exercises/ex0/README.md).


## Use Case

(//TODO: Add Image here)

### ACME Apps Portfolio
- Fiori Elements App (for call center reps)
- SAP Mobile Start (for employee details)
- MDK-based Native App (for technicians)

### Incident Creation (AD161)
- Mary reports an issue with her ACME electronic device.
- Raj, a support representative, logs the incident using the Incident Management app.
- Raj records Mary's contact info, issue details, and conversation notes.

### Incident Resolution (AD162)
- Anna, a technician, uses the ACME Technician Incident Management app.
- Anna views open tasks and those assigned to her.
- Anna selects a task to view the details.
- Anna assigns the task to herself and updates its status (e.g., "In Process").
- Anna travels to Mary's location for on-site service.
- Upon fixing the issue, Anna uploads a resolution image and adds comments.
- Anna requests Mary's digital signature for incident closure.
- Anna, being a traveling technician, accesses payroll and org news via the SAP Mobile Start app. (//TODO Thilo, Thomas, Dennis to review)
- She easily launches the Incident Management app from SAP Mobile Start.
